# Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis with R

This is the repository for the course of **introduction to statistics and data analysis**, taught in Tel-Aviv university. The course is taught in the Engineering faculty in the "Sciences for High Tech" track.

In this repository you will find all the required materials including lecture notes, references, class code, exercises, and more.

## Technical Information

In this course there are 3 lecture hours + 1 exercise (instructor) hour.

Lecturer: Mr. Adi Sarid.

The course will be given in Hebrew, but all the supporting materials will be provided in English.

Garding will be based on homework and a final test (exact split to be announced).

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for this course are:

   * Introduction to Probability. 
   * Mathematical Methods 1.
   
This course is mainly designed for undergraduates with prior knowledge in probability and basic knowledge in math (a bit of Algebra and a bit if Infi), doing a BA/BSc with a "Sciences for High-Tech" track. However, it would also fit graduate students which want to strengthen their knowledge in statistics and data analysis (or learn the very basics of R).

## Goals

This is a course in introduction to statistics and data analysis. The course covers fundemantal terms in statistics, such as significance, hypothesis testing, inference, sampling methods, variable types, modelling (regression, ANOVA), a-parametric tests.

During the course we will use the [R](https://www.r-project.org) language for demonstrations and exercises.

We will use publicly available "open data sets" (e.g., from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) and [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)) to demonstrate the various topics we will cover.

## Topics

   * Overview - from design to implementation: how a statistical research is conducted, from the design phases, through data collection and presentation.
   * Statistical inference and parameter estimation (e.g., average, standard deviation, percentiles).
   * 

## Software Prerequisites

You will need to install [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). RStudio is not mandatory to run R, but it provides a very environment for writing R code. Both software are available for free (for RStudio download the *RStudio Desktop Open Source License* version).
