# Q1 in the attached word file


#Q2 - MLE
let X  be a random Bernoulli variable - 
\[
f(x ; p)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{p^{x}(1-p)^{1-x},} & {x=0,1} \\ {0,} & {\text { otherwise }}\end{array}\right.
\]
1. Show that X = 1 with probability $p$ and that p == 0 with probability $1-p$
2. Suppose we get a random sample of n sample from this distribution. What is the likelihood function $$L(p)$$ of the sample? (what is the probability that $P\left(X_{1}=x_{1}, X_{2}=x_{2}, \ldots, X_{n}=x_{n}\right)$)
3. apply Log on that likelihood function - what do you get?
4. find the $$p$$ that maximizes $$L(p)$$ 

#Q3 - Method of Moments
For this PDF - 
\[f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{\frac{2}{\theta^{2}}(\theta-x)} & {0<x<\theta} \\ {0} & {\text { else }}\end{array}\right.\]
Find $$\theta$$ by the method of moments.

#Q4 
For the exponantiel distribution - 
\[f(x ; \lambda)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{\lambda e^{-\lambda x}} & {x \geq 0} \\ {0} & {x<0}\end{array}\right.\]
Find $$\lambda$$ by MLE and Method of Moments.

# Q5 - R
