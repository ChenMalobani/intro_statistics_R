## Q1 + Q2 in the attached PDF file


## Q3
let X  be a random Bernoulli variable - 
\[
f(x ; p)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{p^{x}(1-p)^{1-x},} & {x=0,1} \\ {0,} & {\text { otherwise }}\end{array}\right.
\]
1. Show that X = 1 with probability $p$ and that p == 0 with probability $1-p$
2. Suppose we get a random sample of n sample from this distribution. What is the likelihood function $L(p)$ of the sample? (what is the probability that $P\left(X_{1}=x_{1}, X_{2}=x_{2}, \ldots, X_{n}=x_{n}\right)$)
3. apply Log on that likelihood function - what do you get?
4. find the $p$ that maximizes $L(p)$ 

## Q4
For this PDF - 
\[f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{\frac{2}{\theta^{2}}(\theta-x)} & {0<x<\theta} \\ {0} & {\text { else }}\end{array}\right.\]
Find $\theta$ by the method of moments.

## Q5 
For the exponantiel distribution - 
\[f(x ; \lambda)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{\lambda e^{-\lambda x}} & {x \geq 0} \\ {0} & {x<0}\end{array}\right.\]
Find $\lambda$ by MLE and Method of Moments.

## Q6 - R
For the following distributions - {Normal,t,chi squared}:
Sample 25 random numbers:
1. Using ggplot2, plot the distribution.
2. Is the funciton symmetric? 
3. Generally speaking (not related to the sample),is the support of the function positive? what is the reletionship between the median and the mean of the distribution?
3. If the distribution relies on the number of examples - what happens to the function when n is 100? ilustrate with a graph.\
* The support of a function is defined as - $\operatorname{supp}(f)=\{x \in X | f(x) \neq 0\}$
