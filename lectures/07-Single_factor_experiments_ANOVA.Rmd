# Reminder from Previous Lecture

We focused on multiple linear regression, which assumes:

$$Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots + \beta_pX_p + \epsilon$$

--
   
   * $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_\epsilon)$
   
   * For hypothesis testing on $\beta$ we also require homoscedastity

--

   * We used the relationship $SS_T = SS_R + SS_E$ to define:
   
   * The coefficient of determination $R^2 = \frac{SS_R}{SS_T}$

--

   * When $0\leq R^2\leq1$. High values correspond to a strong relationship
   
   * For the simple linear regression, we saw that $R^2=\hat\rho^2$, the correlation of $X$ and $Y$

---

# Reminder from Previous Lecture (2) - Solution of the Multiple Linear Regression

We represented the multiple linear regression as a matrix equation:

$$y = X\beta+\epsilon$$

Where:

$$y = \left[\begin{array}{c}y_1\\\vdots\\y_n\end{array}\right], \quad X=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}1 & x_{11} & \ldots & x_{1k}\\\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\1 & x_{n1} & \ldots & x_{nk}\end{array}\right], \quad \beta = \left[\begin{array}{c}\beta_0\\\vdots\\\beta_k\end{array}\right],\quad \epsilon=\left[\begin{array}{c}\epsilon_1\\\vdots\\\epsilon_n\end{array}\right]$$

--

We are looking for $\beta$ which minimizes $L = \epsilon^t\epsilon=(y-X\beta)(y-X\beta)$

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial\beta}=0$$

---

# Reminder (3) - Least Squares Estimation of the Parameters

The resulting equations are given by:

$$X^tX\hat\beta=X^ty$$

--

In case that $X^tX$ is a non-singular matrix (i.e., invertible), the solution is unique and equals

$$\hat\beta = (X^tX)^{-1}X^ty$$

--

Once $\hat{\beta}$ is found, we can use it to predict our values:

$$\hat{y} = X\hat{\beta}$$

--

We can also compute the residuals:

$$e = y-\hat{y}$$

--

Let $p=k+1$ (the number of parameters including the constant $\beta_0$), then:

$$\hat\sigma^2=\frac{\sum{e_i^2}}{n-p}=\frac{SS_E}{n-p}$$

Is an unbiased estimate of $\sigma_\epsilon^2$

---

# Reminder (4) - Hypothesis Tests on Individual Coefficients

We used the fact that:

   * $\hat\beta$ is unbiased and 
   
   * $\operatorname{Var}(\hat\beta_j)=\sigma^2[(X^tX)^{-1}]_{jj}$
   
To devise a hypothesis test for the individual $\hat\beta_j$:

   * $H_0: \beta_j=0$
   
   * $H_1: \beta_j\neq0$

With the statistic

$$T_0=\frac{\hat\beta_j}{\sqrt{\hat\sigma^2C_{jj}}}=\frac{\hat\beta_j}{\operatorname{se}(\hat\beta_j)}$$

---

# Reminder (5) - Hypothesis Tests on All Coefficients

We used the F-statistic 

$$F_0=\frac{SS_R/k}{SS_E/(n-k-1)}=\frac{MS_R}{MS_E}$$

To devise a broader test:

   * $H_0:\beta_1=\beta_2=\ldots=\beta_k=0$
   
   * $H_1: \exists i \text{ such that } \beta_i\neq0$

--

.small[We examined the corresponding ANOVA table]

.small[
| Source of Variation | Sum of Squares | df | Mean Squares | $F_0$ |
|----------------------|-----------------|:-----:|:------------:|---------------------|
| Regression | $SS_R$ | $k$ | $MS_R$ | $\frac{MS_R}{MS_E}$ |
| Error | $SS_E$ | $n-k-1$ | $MS_E$ |  |
| Total | $SS_T$ | $n-1$ |  |  |
]

---

# The adjusted $R^2$

We defined the adjusted $R_\text{adj}^2$: 

$$R^2_\text{adj}= 1 - \frac{SS_E/(n-p)}{SS_T/(n-1)}$$

Which provides a penalty for increasing the number of parameters, however it does not necessarily help us avoid over-fitting.

---

# Confidence and prediction intervals

We talked about confidence and prediction intervals:

--

Confidence interval:

$$\hat\mu_{Y|x_0} + t_{\alpha/2, n-p}\sqrt{\hat\sigma^2x_0^t(X^tX)^{-1}x_0} \leq \mu_{Y|x_0} \leq \hat\mu_{Y|x_0} + t_{1-\alpha/2, n-p}\sqrt{\hat\sigma^2x_0^t(X^tX)^{-1}x_0}$$

--

Prediction interval:

$$\hat y_0 + t_{\alpha/2, n-p}\sqrt{\hat\sigma^2(1+x_0^t(X^tX)^{-1}x_0)} \leq Y_0 \leq \hat y_0 + t_{1-\alpha/2, n-p}\sqrt{\hat\sigma^2(1+x_0^t(X^tX)^{-1}x_0)}$$

--

Let's see this in action, in the following R Shiny app: 
[https://sarid.shinyapps.io/intervals_demo/](https://sarid.shinyapps.io/intervals_demo/)

# Note About Extrapolation - Thought Experiment

What do you think is the problem with trying to provide an extrapolation (fit) and intervals (confidence for mean and prediction for a new observation) for the number of bird strikes with the following parameters:

   * Flight height = 22 thousand feet
   
   * Flight speed = 42 kts
   
   * Sky = "No Cloud"
   
   * Number of engines = $2$

Can you think of a similar example but from a different domain?

# Example - Outliers' Influence

Another "danger" in linear regression is what happens when the data contains outliers. Linear regression is very sensitive in this sense.
.tiny[
```{r example for outliers, fig.dim=c(8,3)}
# wildlife_impacts <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-07-23/wildlife_impacts.csv")
# write_csv(wildlife_impacts %>% count(height), "lectures/data/wildlife_impacts_small.csv")
wildlife_small <- read_csv("data/wildlife_impacts_small.csv", col_types = cols()) %>% 
  mutate(rounded_height = round(height/1000)) %>% 
   group_by(rounded_height) %>% 
   summarize(n = sum(n)) %>% 
   filter(!is.na(rounded_height))

wildlife_err <- wildlife_small
wildlife_err[19, 2] <- 600000 # instead of 6 we multiplied this observation by 1000

p1 <- ggplot(wildlife_small, aes(x = rounded_height, y = log10(n))) + 
   geom_point() + 
   stat_smooth(method = "lm") + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-1, 5)) + theme_bw()
p2 <- ggplot(wildlife_err, aes(x = rounded_height, y = log10(n))) + 
   geom_point() + 
   stat_smooth(method = "lm") + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-1, 5)) + theme_bw()
cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2)
```

# How are Types of Variables Used in Regression?

As you have probably noticed, in the bird-planes example, we used a `sky` variable which has three values (factor). The regression model is linear, if so, how are factor variables treated?

   * Factors are turned into dummy variables (0/1). 
   
      * How many dummies are needed for a 3-level factor? why?
      
   * Characters are treated the same
   
   * Ordinals - depending on definition, might be entered as polynomials, factors, or continuous
   
   * Logicals - as a 0/1 variable

--

```{r some questions on the meaning of coefficients, echo = FALSE}
countdown::countdown(3)
```

Questions (hint: $Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots + \beta_pX_p + \epsilon$):

   * What is the meaning of the coefficient $\beta$ of a logical variable?
   
   * What is the meaning of the coefficient $\beta$ of a factor?
   
   * How would you consider a date type variable?

# Variable Selection via Stepwise Regression

In cases we have many independent variables (i.e., $X_i$s) we want to reduce the complexity of the regression model, and focus only on the most important or most influential variables.

--

For that, we can use the **stepwise regression** algorithm.

   * Backward elimination
   
   * Forward selection
   
   * Backward-forward

--

All algorithms are greedy algorithms: look one step ahead, and choose the best course of action. Hence, the might not reach the optimal solution.

---

# The Backward Elimination Algorithm

   1. Set current model = the "full" model (all independent variables)

--
   
   2. Use some accuracy measure to examine the influence of the removal of each of the variables. E.g., the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC = $-2\log(L) + 2df$)

--
   
   3. Are there a variabled which contributes to the improvement of the measure (e.g. decrease of the AIC)? 
   
      a. **Yes**: Remove the variable which its removal contributes the most (to the improvement of the measure), Update the current model accordingly, and go to step 2. 
      
      b. **No**: Algorithm stops and outputs the current model.

--
      
## The forward selection

A similar algorithm, instead of removing, add variables one at a time

--

## The backward-forward

Combination, at each iteration check both removal and addition.

---

# Intuition for the AIC

AIC = $-2\log(L) + 2df$

The AIC uses the likelihood $L$:

$$L = \prod_{i=1}^n{f(\hat{y}_i)}$$

(Higher liklihood value is better, hence lower $-2\log(L)$ is better)

--

As the number of parameters in the model increases, the model is more prone to overfitting, hence we a penalty of $2df$ (a high $df$, i.e., a lot of parameters is bad for us).

--

Hence, we want to minimize the AIC.

The value of AIC has no meaning, except for the ability to compare two models.

--

Other measures also exist, e.g.: 

   * Montgomery uses the F-Statistic
   
   * Another measure is the BIC = $- 2\log(L) + \log(n)df$

---

# Stepwise Regression - Example: Car Efficiency.

.tiny[
```{r mtcars stepwise regression example}
mtcars_lm <- lm(formula = mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
step(mtcars_lm, direction = "backward")
# step(lm(formula = mpg ~ 1, data = mtcars), 
#      direction = "forward",
#      scope = formula(lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)))
```
]

# Refresher and Recap - Test-like Exercises: Descriptive Statistics

Now we are going to solve three exercises which might resemble exercises which will appear in the test.

.small[Explain the different elements of a boxplot, i.e., in the following chart: 

   1. What does the line in the middle of the box (the blue area) stands for?
   
   2. What do the top and bottom boundaries of the chart's box stand for?
   
   3. What are the whiskers and how do they help us?
   
   4. What does the dot at the upper side of the chart stands for?
   
   5. How would you use a boxplot to recognize a normal distribution?
   
```{r boxplot question, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(y = mpg, x = "")) + 
   geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") + 
   xlab("") +
   theme_bw()
```
]

# Test-like Exercises: Confidence and Prediction Intervals

The following exercise is similar to Walpole, *et al.* (Chapter 9, page 245, ex. 7).

A random sample of $n=100$ car owners show that in the state of Virginia, a car drives 23,500 km per year with a sample standard deviation of 3900 km.

   a. Construct a 99% confidence interval for the average number of kilometers a car is driven annually in Virginia.
   
   b. What can we assert with a 99% confidence interval about the possible size of our error if we estimate the average number of kilometers driven by car owners in Virgina to be 23,500 km?
   
   c. Danny has just moved to Virginia, provide an upper bound (one sided prediction interval) at a 95% confidence interval to the amount of kilometers Danny will drive in the next year.

# Test-like Exercises: Two Sample Tests, p-value

The following exercise is from Walpole, *et al.*, (chapter 9, page 319, ex. 9).

A study at the University of Colorado shows that running increases the percent resting metabolic rate (RMR) in older women. The average RMR of 30 elderly women runners was 34.0% higher than the average RMR of 30 sedentary elderly women. The standard deviations were 10.5 and 10.2 respectively. 

Was there a significant increase in RMR of the women runnders over the sedentary women?

Assume the populations are normally distributed with equal variances. Use a p-value to report you conclusions.

# Experiment Design - Motivation

With methods of hypothesis testing, we were able to discern the differences between two groups (i.e., unpaird two-sample test).

For example trying to see if cars with 4 cylinders are more efficient than cars with 8 cylinders.

.small[
```{r mtcars compare cyls}
mtcars %>% 
   filter(cyl != 6) %>% 
   t.test(formula = mpg ~ cyl, data = .)
```
]

---

# Experiment Design - Motivation (2)

Sometimes, we have more than two levels, in which case, we would like to devise a test which will compare all levels.

--

In the case of a single variable with multiple levels, this is called *single factor experiments* (in the next lecture we will also discuss *multi factor experiments*, when there are multiple levels).

--

Experiments invlove:

   * Conjecture - The hypothesis that motivates the experiment
   
   * Experiment - The actual test performed to investigate the conjecture
   
   * Analysis - Statistical analysis of the collected data
   
   * Conclusions - What has been learned
   
The process is iterated: to improve the experiment (e.g., add new variables or change the methods) and learn more.

---

# Experiment Design - Motivation (3)

We would like a statistical that would highlight the efficiency of cars as a function of the number of cylinders. 

--

A boxplot can visually illustrate what we are looking for, but we cannot yield strength or significance from it.

```{r mtcars cyl comparison}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(y = mpg, x = factor(cyl))) + 
   geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") + 
   theme_bw()
```

--

Question: How would you use linear regression to examine this relationship?
