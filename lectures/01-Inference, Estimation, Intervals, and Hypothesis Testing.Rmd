# Reminder from previous lecture (1/3)

Last lesson we talked about:

--

   * How data analysis is conducted (import -> tidy -> transform, visualize, model -> communicate)

--

   * About R, very broadly (RStudio, Rmd, scripts, functions, packages)
   
--

   * What a tidy data set looks like (rows = observations, columns = variables, aka features)
   
--

   * Variable types (numeric, date, logical, factor - category, ordinal)
   
--

   * Demonstration of the grammer of graphics (`ggplot2`)
   
--

Then, we also discussed **theory**:

--

   * What are point estimates, i.e.:
   
      * $\theta$ is a *population parameter*
      
      * Estimated by the statistic $\hat{\Theta}$, a *point estimator*
      
      * When it is computed (from a sample), it is called a *point estimate* 
      
---

# Reminder from previous lecture (2/3)

   * Desired properties of point estimates are:
   
      * Unbiased: $E\hat{\Theta} - \theta = 0$
      * Low variance: $V(\hat{\Theta})$ as low as possible

--
   
I've shown that: 

   * The average $\bar{X}=\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}$ is unbiased: 
      * $E[\bar{X}] = \mu$
      
   * Its variance is $V(\bar{X})=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$
   
   * In fact, it is the *Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimate* (proof out of scope)
   
--
   
   * We've also seen the bias-variance decomposition, i.e. the Mean Square Error is decomposed into:
      
$$E[(\hat{\Theta}-\theta)^2]=V(\hat{\Theta}) + E(\hat{\Theta} - \theta)^2$$

---

# Reminder from previous lecture (3/3)

We talked about *quantiles*/*percentiles*/*median*:

   * A quantile $q(f)$ of a sample is the **value** for which a specified fraction $f$ of the data values is $\leq q(f)$
   * Note that quartile, quantile, percentile are related/interchangable: 
   
      * 2 quartile = .5 quantile = 50 percentile = median
      
What is the *median* of the normal/exponential/poisson distributions?
