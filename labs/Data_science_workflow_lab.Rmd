In this lab we cover the data science work flow. The lab will walk you through the steps performed in a data science / analysis project:

   * Data import
   * Data tidying
   * Transformation <-> Visualization <-> Modelling
   
The lab will also cover the theoretic elements we covered such confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. This lab is to be performed in groups of 3 (i.e., zoom break rooms).

# Open a new project
